# Endesite
This mod is still heavily into development, don't expect much right now, but I am pleased to have made a 1.0 commit

Mod includes a new ore that spawns in veins of up to 3 from y=0 to y=21 in the end and end highlands

Ingots can smelted from these ores. Currently, only uses are to create mineral blocks and a custom music disc.

More features I promise!!!!

big ups to the 0 people other than me reading this
